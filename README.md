# TicTacToeBot
My first ever Discord bot. Used to play tic tac toe with another user.

The bot allows a discord member to tag another and challenge them to a match. The player can accept or decline, if they accept then they take it in turns placing tokens on a grid until there are no possible moves left or someone matches three tokens in a row.

Typing ```7help``` will show a list of commands that you can use to interact with the bot

I am creating an improved bot with much more features in a different project, using what I learnt from this.
